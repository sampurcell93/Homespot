                <h3>Our story</h3>
                <p>Prior to meeting, we had spent three long (remote) weeks working hard to make a product. This process could've easily failed if we did not share the same values from the start. Once we had the opportunity to formally meet one another, it clicked. We were a team, not because we had been working on the same project, but because we understood each other's values.</p>

                <p>From the beginning, we wanted to share a message. We've learned a lot and we've grown plenty. Are values haven't changed and thus our message hasn't either. We continue to build a product that will give people the opportunity to be themselves.</p>

                <p>We love what Spotted stands for and what it means to our users. We're spotting things everyday. What have you spotted?</p>

                <h3>Our Message</h3>
                <p>We believe in a genuine social experience. We made Spotted to stay connected with our friends in a natural way, and to make every interaction feel exactly as they do in a physical setting.</p>
