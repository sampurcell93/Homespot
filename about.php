            Spotted is a way to explore. It's a way to get out of the house. It's a way to meet new people and discover new places.

                <h3>Our story</h3>
                <p>We set out to make something for ourselves. No focus groups. No catering to anyone other than ourselves. We are all young adults looking to make a change in current social platforms. We wanted to create something without pretense or exclusivity. Our mission was to allow people to better explore their hometown, and to help others do the same.</p>

                <p>To our users,</p>
                <p>The Spotted team curates the content we want to see. We would never ask you to use an app that we wouldn’t use ourselves. From businesses, venues, and community groups, we will be uploading the best of what we see. But we are only a small team. We want to help you discover the best of what’s out there each day, but we need your help. We need you to give back and Spot the best of what you find. This app is about improving the lives of everyone, and we need your help.</p>
                <p>Happy Spotting.</p>

                <h3>Our Values</h3>
                <p>We work hard, just like you. When we finally have a night off, we want to make the most of it. We push ourselves to explore past the neighborhood bar, to find a poetry reading, chili cook-off, or hockey game. We know finding what you like means trying everything. With Spotted, we hope to help everyone discover a passion, or simply have more fun.</p>
